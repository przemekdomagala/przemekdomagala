# Hello!

## I am a third-year Computer Science and AI student at AGH University of Science and Technology (AGH UST).

## Additionally since Nov. 2023 I am part of the AGH Solar Boat Team as a Software Engineer working on Autonomous Boat "Barka". My responsibilities are designing and implementing system architecture and developing algorithms in C++ (with usage of ROS2) for boat autonomous steering.
