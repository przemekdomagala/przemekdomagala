# Hello!

## I am a third-year Computer Science and AI student at AGH University of Science and Technology (AGH UST).

## Additionally, since November 2023, I have been part of the AGH Solar Boat Team as a Software Engineer working on the Autonomous Boat Barka. My responsibilities are designing and implementing system architecture and developing algorithms in C++ (using ROS2) for boat autonomous steering.
